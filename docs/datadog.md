# DataDog Tagging Standards

## Overview
Tagging in DataDog is essential for organizing, filtering, and aggregating metrics, logs, and traces. Consistent tagging helps improve monitoring, troubleshooting, and cost analysis.

## **DataDog Tagging Constraints**
- **Tag Format**: Tags are key-value pairs formatted as `key:value`.
- **Character Limits**:
  - Tag keys: Up to **200 characters**.
  - Tag values: Up to **200 characters**.
- **Allowed Characters**: Tag keys and values may only contain alphanumeric characters, `-` , `_` , `.` (DataDog allows other characters, but those violate our standards for other technologies)
- **Case Sensitivity**: Tags are **case-sensitive** (`env:Prod` is different from `env:prod`).
- **Maxium Tags Per Resource**: Each resource can have up to **1000 tags**.

## Standardized Tagging Format
To ensure consistency, all DataDog tags should follow a structured naming convention prefixed with `ts-` (tagging-standard).

The exceptions to this standard are the `env` and `service` tags. These specific keys are required by DataDog, so the `ts-` prefix not required

## Applying Multiple Values for DataDog Tags
WIP

## Tagging Best Practices
1. **Apply Tags Consistently**: Use a uniform structure for all resources.
2. **Use Automation**: Implement tagging policies using DataDog APIs and automation scripts.
3. **Limit the Number of Tags**: Avoid excessive tags to prevent complexity.
4. **Use Tags for Efficient Filtering**: Leverage tags to segment and analyze metrics and logs effectively.
5. **Review and Update Tags Regularly**: Conduct audits to ensure proper usage and relevancy.

By following these tagging standards, teams can enhance observability, improve operational efficiency, and gain better insights in DataDog.
