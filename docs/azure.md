# Azure Tagging Standards

## Overview
Azure supports resource tagging to help with organization, cost management, and governance. However, Azure has specific limitations and best practices that must be followed when implementing tagging standards.

## Tagging Limitations in Azure
- **Tag Format**: Tags are name-value pairs where names and values are specified separately. Names are required, values are optional.
- **Character Limits**:
  - Tag names: Up to **512 characters** (except for storage accounts, which have a limit of 128 characters).
  - Tag values: Up to **256 characters**.
- **Allowed Characters**: Tag names and values may only contain alphanumeric characters, `-` , `_` , `.` (Azure allows other characters, but those violate our standards for other technologies)
- **Case Sensitivity**: Tag names are **case-insensitive**, but values are **case-sensitive**.
- **Maximum Tags per Resource**: Each resource can have up to **50 tags**.
- **Inherited Tags**: Tags applied to resource groups are **not automatically inherited** by resources within the group.

## Standardized Tagging Format
To ensure consistency, all tags in Azure should follow a structured naming convention prefixed with `ts` (tagging-standard).

## Applying Multiple Values for Azure Tags
WIP

## Tagging Best Practices
1. **Apply Tags Consistently**: Ensure that all resources follow the standardized format.
2. **Use Automation**: Utilize Azure Policy to enforce required tags on resource creation.
3. **Review and Update Tags Regularly**: Maintain accurate tags by conducting periodic audits.
4. **Use Resource Groups for Better Organization**: Group related resources and apply shared tags where applicable.
5. **Leverage Tagging for Cost Management**: Assign relevant tags to track and optimize cloud spending.

By following these standards, teams can ensure better resource management and alignment with organizational policies in Azure.
