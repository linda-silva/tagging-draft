# GitHub Enterprise Tagging Standards

## Overview
GitHub does not have a native tagging system designed for resource attribution. Tags are typically used for tracking specific releases or significant commits. These activities are outside of the scope of this tagging initiative.

Because tagging will be used in other platforms to track the resource usage, we will not be using tags to track usage in GitHub Enterprise.
