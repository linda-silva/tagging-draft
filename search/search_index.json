Tagging is the practice of assigning metadata to resources in order to improve organization, management, and reporting. Tags are key-value pairs that provide meaningful information about resources across various platforms. Why We Tag Tagging helps with: Cost Management : Understanding spending across projects and teams. Resource Organization : Easily finding and managing resources by environment, team, project or function. Automation : Enforcing policies and applying configurations automatically. Security & Compliance : Ensuring resources adhere to governance policies. Tagging Limitations and Standardization We currently use tagging across multiple technologies to standardize resource identification and facilitate efficient management. Each technology may have different tagging capabilities, but tags will look similar across different technologies as we aim to maintain consistency. To ensure compatibility across all resources, our tagging standard follows the most restrictive limitation of each platform. General Tagging Constraints Constraint Standard Limit Platform with Restriction Tag Key Length 63 characters Kubernetes Tag Value Length 63 characters Kubernetes Allowed Characters Alphanumeric, - , _ , . Varies by platform, limited by Kubernetes Do Not Use Whitespace, #,%, $, etc. Varies by platform Case Format Lowercase DataDog, Kubernetes Max Tags per Resource 50 Azure, AWS Enforcement As defined in this document, there will be required and optional tags that apply to all technologies, and some that are specific to a particular platform. The detailed specifications can be found in the doc for each technology. All tagging should be treated as if enforcement is in place through utilities as this will eventually become the case. Naming Standards Tags must follow a structured naming convention to ensure uniformity across different platforms. As much as possible, tag names should be similar across technologies. This makes it easier to search and understand tags across platforms. Each tagging key will have the preface ts which stands for tagging-standard .
