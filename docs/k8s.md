# Kubernetes Tagging Standards

## Overview
Tagging in Kubernetes is primarily achieved through **labels** and **annotations**. Labels are used for identifying and organizing resources, while annotations store additional metadata.

## Tagging Limitations in Kubernetes
- **Tag Format:** Tags are applied as labels in key:value pairs
- **Character Limits**:
  - Tag keys: Up to 63 characters**.
  - Tag values: Up to 63 characters**.
- **Allowed characters:** Tag keys and values may only contain alphanumeric characters, `-` , `_` , `.` (Kubernetes allows other characters, but those violate our standards for other technologies)
- **Case Sensitivity**: Tags are **case-sensitive** (`env:Prod` is different from `env:prod`). All tags will be created in lowercase to comply with standards in other technologies.
- **Maximum Tags Per Resource**: There are no limits on the number of labels per resource

## Standardized Tagging Format
To ensure consistency, all Kubernetes labels should follow a structured naming convention prefixed with `ts` (tagging-standard).

## Applying Multiple Values for K8s Tags

## Tagging Best Practices
1. **Use Labels for Selection and Grouping**: Leverage labels to group resources for scheduling and management.
2. **Limit Label Length**: Keep labels concise and meaningful.
3. **Use Annotations for Metadata**: Store descriptions, links, and non-identifying information in annotations.
4. **Automate Labeling**: Use admission controllers and GitOps practices to enforce labeling policies.
5. **Regularly Audit Labels**: Ensure tags remain accurate and relevant over time.

By following these standards, teams can enhance Kubernetes resource organization, improve automation, and streamline cost tracking.
