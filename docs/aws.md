# AWS Tagging Standards

## Overview
AWS supports resource tagging to help with organization, cost tracking, and access management. AWS tagging standards should be applied consistently across all resources to enable better governance and operational efficiency.

## **AWS Tagging Constraints**
- **Tag Format**: Tags are key-value pairs where keys and values are specified separately. Keys are required, values are optional.
- **Character Limits**:
  - Tag keys: Up to **128 characters**.
  - Tag values: Up to **256 characters**.
- **Allowed Characters**: Tag keys and values may only contain alphanumeric characters, `-` , `_` , `.` (AWS allows other characters, but those violate our standards for other technologies)
- **Case Sensitivity**: Tag keys are **case-sensitive**, meaning `Environment` and `environment` are treated as different tags. All tags will be created in lowercase to comply with standards in other technologies.
- **Maximum Tags per Resource**: Each AWS resource can have up to **50 tags**.
- **Tag Propagation**: AWS does not automatically propagate tags across linked resources, such as EC2 instances and attached volumes. AWS generated tags are typically prefixed with `aws`, so this prefix cannot be used in user-defined tag keys.

## Naming Standards
To ensure uniformity, all tags in AWS should follow a structured naming convention prefixed with `ts` (tagging-standard).

## Applying Multiple Values for AWS Tags
WIP

## Tagging Best Practices
1. **Apply Tags Consistently**: Ensure all resources follow the standardized format.
2. **Use AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies (SCPs)**: Enforce tagging requirements across accounts.
3. **Automate Tagging with AWS Lambda and Tag Policies**: Ensure compliance using automation.
4. **Review and Update Tags Regularly**: Conduct periodic audits to maintain tag accuracy.
5. **Leverage AWS Cost Allocation Tags**: Assign relevant tags to track and optimize cloud spending.

By following these standards, teams can improve resource management, streamline operations, and enhance cost visibility in AWS.
